Open Science is a [Strategic Objective]() of the NNA Community
Office.  

# What is Open Science?

The US Federal Government [defines](https://open.science.gov/) Open
Science as "...the principle and practice of making research products
and processes available to all, while respecting diverse cultures,
maintaining security and privacy, and fostering collaborations,
reproducibility, and equity."

On January 11, 2023, the White House
Office of Science and Technology Policy launched the _Year of Open
Science_ {@whostp_yos_2023}.  [Multiple Federal Agencies](), including NSF, NASA and NOAA
have launched programmes and funding opportunites to promote and
foster Open Science practices.  Similar efforts are underway in other
countries and regions.


# Why Open Science?

Open science facilitates transparent, reproducible science through
sharing data, methods and software used in research, as well as
through open access to the results of that research.  It also
encourages diversity within and access to research not only for
academic but also for non-academic participants.  As such, open
science aligns with the NNA-CO strategic goals of co-production of
knowledge, and education and outreach.

Open Science is also kinder science @lowndes_open_2019.  It allows
researchers in academia, as well as citizen scientists, to do science
in a more efficient manner.  Data are easier to find, access and use
when they are stored in stable, long-term, freely accessible archives.
Openly sharing open source, non-proprietory software tools and code
used for analysis not only means that fellow researchers can reuse
these tools, getting to do science faster, but also allows analyses to
be reproduced and errors discovered, _and corrected_,
quickly. Ensuring academic papers are openly accessible to all, not
restricted behind paywalls, will not only lead to increased
understanding of scientific results but also broaden participation in
science.


# Supporting Open Science at the NNA-CO

The NNA-CO will promote and share resources for the openness,
integrity, and reproducibility of NNA-funded research.  We will
collaborate with the NSF Arctic Data Center (ADC) to create greater
awareness amongst NNA investigators of data requirements, and of
available resources for archiving their datasets with ADC for spatial,
temporal, and thematic discoverability.  We will support researchers
in managing and archiving data; applying the principles of Open Data )
to their research ([FAIR
Principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) & [CARE
Principles](https://www.gida-global.org/care)); and understanding best
practices as they deal with different data types (for example,
physical environmental observations vs. social science data
vs. Indigenous community data).  Following our Guiding Principles, we
will work to broaden the involvement of Indigenous communities and
underrepresented groups in Arctic science through promoting open and
equitable access to data and results.  Working with the NNA-CO
Advisory Boards, NNA researchers, and the wider research community, we
will facilitate the development of best practices for open science in
the context of interdisciplinary and collaborative Arctic research
while recognizing and upholding Indigenous data sovereignty.
