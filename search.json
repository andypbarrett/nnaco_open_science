As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are limited in how effectively they can work with software and data. Computing workflows need to follow the same practices as lab projects and notebooks, with organized data, documented steps, and the project structured for reproducibility, but researchers new to computing often don’t know where to start. This paper presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill. These practices, which encompass data management, programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, tracking work, and writing manuscripts, are drawn from a wide variety of published sources from our daily lives and from our work with volunteer organizations that have delivered workshops to over 11,000 people since 2010. - Url: https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510 \nTitle: Best Practices for Scientific Computing - Author: Wilson, Greg and Aruliah, D.

This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores. - Url: https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v059.i10 \nTitle: Why NASA and federal agencies are declaring this the Year of Open Science - Author: Gentemann, Chelle - Year: 2023 - Abstract: Here’s how NASA is incentivizing open science, and how you can too. - Url: https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00019-y \nTitle: Credit Where Credit Is Due - Author: Parsons, Mark and Katz, Daniel and Langseth, Madison and Ramapriyan, Hampapuram and Ramdeen, Sarah - Year: 2022 - Abstract: Promoting open, inclusive, transparent, and traceable science requires that scientists revamp the ways in which we acknowledge all manner of contributions to research. - Url: https://eos.org/opinions/credit-where-credit-is-due \nTitle: Fundamentals in Data Management for Qualitative and Quantitative Arctic Research - Author: Amber, E.

Training is often organized on a grassroots level, offered by early career researchers, for early career researchers. Buffet style courses that cover many topics can inspire participants to try new things; however, they can also be overwhelming. Participants who want to implement new practices may not know where to start once they return to their research team. We describe ten simple rules to guide participants of relevant training courses in implementing robust research practices in their own projects, once they return to their research group. This includes (1) prioritizing and planning which practices to implement, which involves obtaining support and convincing others involved in the research project of the added value of implementing new practices; (2) managing problems that arise during implementation; and (3) making reproducible research and open science practices an integral part of a future research career. We also outline strategies that course organizers can use to prepare participants for implementation and support them during this process. - Url: https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010750 \nTitle: Rethinking academia in a time of climate crisis - Author: Urai, Anne E and Kelly, Clare - Year: 2023 - Abstract: Addressing the climate crisis requires radical and urgent action at all levels of society. Universities are ideally positioned to lead such action but are largely failing to do so. At the same time, many academic scientists find their work impeded by bureaucracy, excessive competitiveness, and a loss of academic freedom. Here, drawing on the framework of “Doughnut Economics,” developed by Kate Raworth, we suggest seven new principles for rethinking the norms of scientific practice. Based on these, we propose a call to action, and encourage academics to take concrete steps towards the creation of a flourishing scientific enterprise that is fit for the challenges of the 21st century. - Url: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.84991 \nTitle: FACT SHEET: Biden-Harris Administration Announces New Actions to Advance Open and Equitable Research OSTP - Author: White House OSTP - Year: 2023 - Abstract: OSTP launches Year of Open Science to advance national open science policies across the federal government in 2023 Today, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) announced new actions to advance open and equitable research, including new grant funding, improvements in research infrastructure, broadened research participation for emerging scholars, and expanded opportunities… - Url: https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2023/01/11/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-actions-to-advance-open-and-equitable-research/"

Two keys pieces of advice are worth highlighting.\n\nStart slowly. Select a few Open Science practices to start with rather than trying to follow every suggestion. The NASA TOPS program suggest a few first steps.\nIncorporate Open Science practices at the start of a project, rather than at the end when you are trying to publish a manuscript of wrap-up a project. Trying to backwards engineer an analysis workflow or find URL or DOI for a dataset months after you downloaded it is time consuming and frustrating. Having a system to record these as you work on the project will save time in the long-run. Rodrigues (2023), advocates DRY WIT: Don’t Repeat Yourself; and Write IT down.\n\nThe TOPS (2023) is a nice tiered approach gives guidance to individuals, reasearch teams and organizations in adopting Open Sciences practices"

Although you may not be writing production software for Google, or some other tech company, you are developing software to collect, clean and analyse data, and to create plots and tables. Taking simple steps to document code and write clean_code will make your code easier to understand and reduce anxiety created by needing to share code. The resources outlined below are a good start.\nSoftware Capentries\nTwo papers (Wilson et al. 2014, 2017) lay out a set of best and good enough practices for scientific software sevelopment.\nRodrigues (2023) gives an in depth guide to building reproducible workflows; including using version control systems like GitHub, writing clean code, and documenting workflows. The approach is a tutorial style with hands-on coding. The focus is on the R language but the approach applies to other langauges such as python. It assumes some knowledge of writing code."
