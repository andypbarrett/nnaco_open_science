As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are limited in how effectively they can work with software and data. Computing workflows need to follow the same practices as lab projects and notebooks, with organized data, documented steps, and the project structured for reproducibility, but researchers new to computing often don’t know where to start. This paper presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill. These practices, which encompass data management, programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, tracking work, and writing manuscripts, are drawn from a wide variety of published sources from our daily lives and from our work with volunteer organizations that have delivered workshops to over 11,000 people since 2010.\n\nUrl: https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510\n\nCitation:"

Two keys pieces of advice are worth highlighting.\n\nStart slowly. Select a few Open Science practices to start with rather than trying to follow every suggestion. The NASA TOPS program suggest a few first steps.\nIncorporate Open Science practices at the start of a project, rather than at the end when you are trying to publish a manuscript of wrap-up a project. Trying to backwards engineer an analysis workflow or find URL or DOI for a dataset months after you downloaded it is time consuming and frustrating. Having a system to record these as you work on the project will save time in the long-run. Rodrigues (2023), advocates DRY WIT: Don’t Repeat Yourself; and Write IT down.\n\nThe TOPS (2023) is a nice tiered approach gives guidance to individuals, reasearch teams and organizations in adopting Open Sciences practices"
